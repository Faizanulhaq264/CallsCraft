1. Call isnt joining zoom call if i go back and need to create a new call, 
    need to refresh the page to do that which doesnt make sense
2. We can maybe create a endpoint that ends users all current calls before starting a call
3. Integrate accomplishments list into start call sequence
    Do this by changing the data base to store each accomplishment as a new row but with its call id
    This way we can differentiate whcih accomplishments belongs to which call
4. Integrate end call endpoint
    It might need changes due to the changing nature of the project
